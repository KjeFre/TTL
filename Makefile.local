# On which other modules do we want this one to depend?
# The modules indicated in DEPSLIBLOCAL will be linked in
# when making an app in this module, and their include
# files are available to this module's code.
#
# The libdirs should be organized like this: Every module
# contain one subdir for every platform (linux, sgi, hp-pa,
# winnt etc.). Most of the time only one exists, but the feature
# is there so that you can use the same working directory on
# multiple platforms (for instance when the working dir is on a
# server. Each of these again should contain the
# nopt/ and opt/ subdirs, that actually contain the lib file
# and the .o files.
