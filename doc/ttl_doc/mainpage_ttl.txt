\section aboutdoc About TTL
TTL is a \e generic triangulation library developed
at <A HREF="http://www.sintef.no">SINTEF Applied Mathematics</A>, and now managed by
<A HREF="http://www.simula.no/ogl">Oslo Graphics Lab</A>.
TTL is generic in the sense that it does not rely on a special data structure.
Thus, you can operate with your own application data structure and benefit from a
variety of generic algorithms in TTL that can work directly on any data structure
for triangulations.

If you do not want to bother with making your own data structure and adapt it to
TTL, you can use one of the data structures that comes with TTL and use TTL
as you would use any other triangulation library.

TTL is written in C++ and makes extensive use of function templates as a generic
tool for the \ref api "application programming interface". Moreover,
it offers a new programming philosophy for triangulations
based on a few clear and robust algebraic concepts which makes it easy to build
applications and extend them with new functionality.
The programming philosophy is somewhat like STL, The Standard Template Library,
with iterator concepts. The code is limited to a few include files with the 
main interface in  \ref ttl "namespace ttl".

Examples of generic tools currently available are:\n
- Incremental Delaunay triangulation
- Constrained Delaunay triangulation
- Insert and remove nodes in a triangulation
- Searching and traversal operations
- Misc. queries for extracting information for visualisation systems etc.

\subsection datastructures Data structures distributed with TTL
A data structure represents the \em topology of the triangulation, i.e., how nodes,
edges and triangles are glued together to form a triangulation.
The well-known <A HREF="../../HalfEdge_doc/html/index.html">half-edge data structure</A>
is distributed with TTL and can be used if you do not have your own data structure. 
In the future we will also make other common data structures available.

\subsection startdoc Getting started
- If you just want to make a Delaunay triangulation from a set of points
  in the plane (with associated height values), compile and run
  the sample program in the file \ref hesimplest "main.cpp".
  The program also demonstrates insertion of nodes and constraints, removal of nodes
  and other useful functionality in TTL.
  Modify the program for your needs.
  This program uses the <A HREF="../../HalfEdge_doc/html/index.html">half-edge data structure</A>.

- If you want to adapt your own data structure and utilize the generic
  concepts of TTL, read the section \ref api. Implement your own \ref hed::Dart "DartType"
  and \ref hed::TTLtraits "TraitsType" classes (or structs) interfacing your data structure
  similar to that of the <A HREF="../../HalfEdge_doc/html/index.html">half-edge data structure</A>.
  Make a sample program similar to that of \ref hesimplest "main.cpp"
  and run Delaunay triangulation, remove/insert nodes etc., using
  function templates in \ref ttl "namespace ttl".

\subsection funding Funding
The development of TTL has been supported by the
<a href="http://www.forskningsradet.no">Research Council of Norway</a>
under the research program 117644/223,
<a href="http://www.sintef.no/static/AM/dynamap/index.html">
"DYNAMAP II, Management and Use of Geodata"</a>.

\subsection platform Platform and compiler
TTL runs on a number of platforms, including Unix, Linux and Windows.
If you have any problems it is straightforward to modify the source code.
The C++ compiler must support the syntax: \c function<     \c >(..,..) for calling
function templates.
