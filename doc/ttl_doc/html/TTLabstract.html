Triangulations representing surfaces constructed from scattered measurement data can be 
dealt with algebraically using principles of generalized maps, or G-maps. High level 
abstraction of functions operating on triangulations is achieved using G-maps, which 
are developed for general boundary based topological models. Generic design of a 
Delaunay triangulation algorithm and of functions operating on triangulations are 
presented, and principles of implementation using function templates in the 
C++ programming language are shown. Since the operations can be algebraically 
defined and implemented generically, a triangulation library based on this 
concept can operate on arbitrary data structures.
